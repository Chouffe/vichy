\begin{abstract}

The purpose of this project is to allow several persons to modify the same document at the same time, the changes being applied on every versions. The behavior is then the same as the one of a Google Doc. Instead of using collaborative editing in a browser, this article presents a solution to give the text editor Vim a plugin for collaborative editing. Different modules and technologies have been used, among them the NoSQL database MongoDB which is used to store all the data of users and the
modifications they do. We use these data to have some statistics about the developing process. For instance, we can know who made the last change. Besides this, ShareJS, an Operational Transform library for NodeJS, is used to deal with concurrent editing and to synchronise all the different versions available.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

The development of the Internet has changed the way people work. Whereas one used to share carefully the work among members of a team between two meetings, one now work at the same time on the same parts of the project thanks to real-time tools. The success of the famous Google Documents is a good example of the development of collaborative work for the general public. The idea of this project was to adapt the same concept to Vim, a well-known text editor very popular among nerds.
This paper presents in the first part the method which has been used on the client side to extract the modifications in Vim. In the second part, we explain the database structure and how we managed to solve the problem of concurrency with ShareJS. Some statistics are extracted from the database to give every user some information about the coding process. Finally, we explain in the conclusion how the solution can be improved or at least made differently.
