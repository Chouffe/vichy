\begin{abstract}

The propose of this project is to permet several persons to modify the same document at the same time, the changes being applied on every versions. The behavior is then the same as a Google Doc, but we'd like to make it a plugin, for the text editor vim, as there is no such plugin to date.  We'll have a server with a database on it,
storing all the modifications done by the users, and synchronising all the differents versions available. The plugin will have a playback system that will allow a user to watch all the modifications done to date. Besides, one could see who edited what parts of the document.
